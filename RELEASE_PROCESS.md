# Release Process

## General Information

In the Open Component Model organization, the *main development* is done on the
`main` branch. Thus, the `main` branch is used to generate minor releases. The
*patch development* is done on dedicated release branches created for a
particular minor release.

A release is generated by calling a specific `release` GitHub action. It is
executed on the branch which should be released - regardless whether it is a
patch or a minor release. Based on the content of the branch, the release action
decides what has to be done (for further details, read the release workflow
section).

In any case, a pre-release may be created by specifying a pre-release suffix for
the release action execution.

## Release Workflow

The content of a branch can be released by the GitHub `release` action. The name
of the release is based on the content of the file [`VERSION`](./VERSION) which
is updated automatically said `release` action. During development, the
content of this file is the complete release name of the release currently under
development and the suffix `-dev` (e.g. `0.1.0-dev`). The content of this file
is used for generating the version information compiled into the ocm
executables.

If a release is created, the `-dev`-suffix is removed and an optional
pre-release suffix is appended to generate the name of the release (e.g. `0.1.0`
or `0.1.0-alpha1`) and to prepare a commit for the release which is used to
create a release tag.

Additionally, this commit will also add a new release note file
under [./docs/releasenotes](./docs/releasenotes). It is generated from the
appropriate draft release with the basic release name (e.g. `0.1.0`). After the
release is done, for final releases, a new commit is created to prepare the
development of the next release by adapting the [`VERSION`](./VERSION) file
again. Thereby, if the patch level is `0` (e.g. `0.1.0`), the minor version
number is increased (e.g. `0.2.0`). If the patch level is not zero (e.g.
`0.1.1`), the patch level is increased (e.g. `0.1.2`). This commit is pushed to
the branch for which you created the release, and it therefore contains the
release commit in its history.

When creating a minor release, it is possible to optionally create a patch
branch. In this case, a new branch with the name `releases/<release-name>` is
created. This branch is prepared with a commit which adjusts the patch level in
the [`VERSION`](./VERSION) file to `1` (e.g. for release `0.1.0`, the patch
branch is prepared with `0.1.1`).

## Creating a Release

A release is created for a branch - typically, the main branch or a patch
branch - by executing the GitHub action `release`. Therefore, you have to
specify the branch to release, and you can optionally indicate to create a patch
branch or to create a pre-release by specifying a pre-release name.

## Preparing a Patch Release

There are 2 possibilities to create and release patches.

1) If during the creation of a minor release the option to create patch branch
   has been selected, there is already a patch branch `releases/<minor-release>`
   which can be used to prepare commits to be released.
2) If no patch branch has been created in advance for any existing minor
   release, a patch branch can be created using the GitHub action
   `release-branch`. Therefore, you have to select the tag of the intended
   release. As a result, the patch branch `releases/<minor-release>` is prepared
   with the appropriate version file (containing `x.<minor-release>.1-dev`).

   > **NOTE**:
   > If this is not possible because the release is older than the latest
   version of the release action, then you have to
   > manually specify the intended tag in the input field of the action.

On the patch branch (like on the main branch), new commits can be added using
pull requests. Once a patch should be
released, the release action is executed on the patch branch (theoretically, for
patches, pre-releases are also
possible).

## What is part of a release?

During the build of a release, an OCM CTF (Common Transport Format Archive) is
created (through `make ctf`), containing all the provided component versions
described by the actual git snapshot. This archive is then published to
ghcr.io/open-component-model/ocm. Additionally, a GitHub release is created,
exposing the OCM CTF and the ocm-cli executables for various platforms. These
executables are build using the go releaser plugin. Furthermore, packages for
various package managers (e.g. brew, debian or chocolatey) are created and
uploaded to the respective package repositories. All currently supported
installation methods are described
[here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
