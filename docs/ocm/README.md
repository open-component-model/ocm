# Open Component Model Specification

This specification is divided into three parts:

- Layer 1: The [model elements](model.md) defined by the Open Component Model
- Layer 2: The [abstract operations](operations.md) , which must be provided to
  interact with those model elements stored in any OCM persistence
- Layer 3: The [interoperability specifications](interoperability.md) describing how the model elements
  are mapped to elements of an underlying persistence layer
  (for example and OCI registry)
