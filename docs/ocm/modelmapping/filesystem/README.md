# OCM Mapping to a Filesystem Structure

The filesystem structure is stored in a 
- directory
- tar file
- or GNU-zipped tar file (tgz)

The file structure is based on the [OCI mapping](../oci/README.md).
The resulting OCI artefacts are stored according to the
[filesystem mapping of OCI artefacts](../../../../pkg/contexts/oci/repositories/ctf/README.md)
and is called *Common Transport Format* (CTF).
