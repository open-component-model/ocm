## Predefined Labels

Resources, sources, references and component versions feature [labels](../names/labels.md)
with arbitrarily structured values.

The Open Component Model (OCM) allows defining labels with a predefined meaning
relevant for the interpretation of a component descriptor. Such label names
lack a namespace and are just flat names.

So far, no predefined labels are defined centrally.
