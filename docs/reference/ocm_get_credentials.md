### Description


Try to resolve a given consumer specification against the configured credential
settings and show the found credential attributes.

For the following usage contexts with matchers and standard identity matchers exist:

  - <code>OCIRegistry</code>: OCI registry credential matcher
  - <code>exact</code>: exact match of given pattern set
  - <code>hostpath</code>: Host and path based credential matcher
  - <code>partial</code>: complete match of given pattern ignoring additional attributes

The used matcher is derived from the consumer attribute <code>type</code>.
For all other consumer types a matcher matching all attributes will be used.
The usage of a dedicated matcher can be enforced by the option <code>--matcher</code>.
