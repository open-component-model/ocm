# Architectural Decision Record: Rework of Referebce Hints

### Meaning of Reference Hints

During the transport of software artifacts referenced from external artifact repositories like
OCI registries, they might be stored as  blobs along with the component version (access method
`localBlob`. If those  component versions are transported again into a repository landscape they
might be uploaded again to external repositories.

To provide useful identities for storing those artifacts hints in external repositories, again,
the original identity of the external artifact must be stored along with the local blob.

### Current Solution

The access method origibally used to refernce the exterbal artfact provides a reference hint,
which can later be used by the blob uploaders to reconstruct a useful identity.
Therefore, the `localBlob` access method is able to keep track of this hint value.
The hint is just a string, which needs to be intepreted by the uploader.

### Problems with Current Solution

The assumprion behind the current solution is that the uploader will always upload the
artifactinto a similar repository, again. Therefore, there would be a one-to-one relation 
between access method and uploader.

Unfortunately this is not true in all cases:
- There are access methods now (like`wget`), which are able to handle any kind of artifact blob
  with different natural repositoty types and identity schemes.
- Therefore, 
  - it can neither provide an implicit reference hint anymore
  - nor there is a one-to-one relation to a typed uploader anymore.
- artifacts might be uploadable to different repository types using different
  identity schemes.

This problem is partly covered by allowing to specify a hint along with those access methods
similar to the `localBlob` access method. But this can only be a workarround, because
- the hint is not typed and potential target repositories might use diufferent identity schemes
- it is possible to store a single hint, only.

### Proposed Solution

Hints have to be typed, to allow uploaders to know what identites are provided and how the
hint string has to be interpreted. Additionally, it must be possible to store
mulltiple hints for an artifact.

To be compatible a serialization format is defined for a list of type hints, which maps such
a list to a single string.

The library provides a new type `ReferenceHint = map[string]string`, which provides access to 
a formal hint, by providing access to a set of string attributes. There are three predefined
attributes:
- `type` the formal type of the hint (may be empty to cover old component versions)
  The types are defined like the resource types. The following types are defined for now:
  - `oci`: OCI identity given by the attribute `reference` with the cirrently used format
  - `maven`: Maven identity (GAV) given by the attribute `reference` with the currently used format
  - `npm`: Node package identity given by the attribute `reference` with the currently used
    format
- `reference`: the standard attribute to hold a string representation for the identity.
- `implicit`: Value `true` indicated an implicit hint (as used today) provided by an accessmethods.

New Hint types my use other attributes.

An access method can provide (and store) implicit hints as before. THose hints are indicated
to be implicit. When composing an access method it is only allowed to store implicit hints.
This is completely compatible to the current solution.

Additionally, multiplehints can be stored abd delivered.

To support any kind of hint for any scenario, the artifact metadata (resources and sources)
is extended to store explicit hints, which will be part of the normalized form.
This is done by an additional attribute `referenceHints`. It is a list of string maps
holding the hint attributes (including the hint type).

Uploaders are called with the aggrgation of explicit (from metadata) and implicit (from
access methods) hints. Hereby, the explicit hints have precedence.

If an uploader creates a local access specification, only implicit hints may be stored, here.

There is a new composition option (`--refhint`) now for composing resources
and sources for the CLI. It accepts an attribute setting. Multiple such options starting with the `type`attribute are used to compose a single hint.

### Hint Serialization Format

In general a hint is serialized to the following string
<center>
    [&lt;*type*>`::]`&lt;*attribute*>`=`&lt;*value*>{`,`&lt;*attribute*>`=`&lt;*value*>}
</center>

The type is not serilaized as attribute. The `implicit` attribute is never serialized is the string is stored in an access specification.
If no type is known the type part is omiited.

A list of hints is serialized to

<center>
   &lt;*hint*>{`;`&lt;*hint*>}
</center>

*Attributes* names consist of alpha numeric cha≈ïacters, only.
If a *value*may not cotain a `::`. If it contains a `;`, `,` or `"`
character it must be given in double quotes.
In the double quote form any `"` or `\` character has to be escaped by
a preceding `\` character.

To be as compatible as possible, a single attribute hint with the attribute
`reference` is serialized as naked value (as before) if there are no special
characters enforcing a quoted form.

### Incompatible Changes:

#### Componwnt Version Representation

- The new library creates always typed hints for new elements. Old hints are
  left as they are. This means, that old versions of the OCM tooling 
  cannot work correctly with component versions with persisted hints in 
  access specifications
- If explicit hints are created, they are not observed by old tool versions.
  Those component versions cannot be verified by an older tool version.

#### OCM Library

- The `SetResourceBlob`and `SetSourceBlob` API method no accepts 
  a hint array instead of a string-based hint.

- Uploaders provided by a plugin now get a serialized hint list
  instead of a simple untyped reference format.
- 
- There are new options for creating resource(source access objects.
