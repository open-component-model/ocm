TOI is an abbreviation for (T)iny (O)CM (I)nstallation. It is a simple
application framework on top of the Open Component Model, that can
be used to describe image based installation executors and installation
packages (see topic <CMD>ocm toi bootstrapping</CMD> in form of resources
with a dedicated type. All involved resources are hereby taken from a component
version of the Open Component Model, which supports all the OCM features, like
transportation.

The framework consists of a generic bootstrap command
(<CMD>ocm toi bootstrap componentversions</CMD>) and an arbitrary set of image
based executors, that are executed in containers and fed with the required
installation data by th generic command.
