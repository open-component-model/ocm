# Basic Usage of OCM Repositories

This [tour](example.go) illustrates the basic usage of the API to
access component versions in an OCM repository.

You can just call the main program with some config file argument
with the following content:

```yaml
component: github.com/mandelsoft/examples/cred1
repository: ghcr.io/mandelsoft/ocm
version: 0.1.0
```
