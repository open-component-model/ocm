# Working with Credentials

<a id="credentials"></a>

This tour illustrates the basic handling of credentials
using the OCM library. The library provides
an extensible framework to bring together credential providers
and credential consumers in a technology-agnostic way.

It covers four basic scenarios:

- [`basic`](/examples/lib/tour/03-working-with-credentials/01-using-credentials.go) Writing to a repository with directly specified credentials.
- [`context`](/examples/lib/tour/03-working-with-credentials/02-basic-credential-management.go) Using credentials via the credential management to publish a component version.
- [`read`](/examples/lib/tour/03-working-with-credentials/02-basic-credential-management.go) Read the previously created component version using the credential management.
- [`credrepo`](/examples/lib/tour/03-working-with-credentials/03-credential-repositories.go) Providing credentials via credential repositories.

## Running the example

You can call the main program with a config file option (`--config <file>`) and the name of the scenario.
The config file should have content similar to:

```yaml
repository: ghcr.io/mandelsoft/ocm
username:
password:
```

Set your favorite OCI registry and don't forget to add the repository prefix for your OCM repository hosted in this registry.

## Walkthrough

### Writing to a repository with directly specified credentials

As usual, we start with getting access to an OCM context
object.

```go
	ctx := ocm.DefaultContext()
```

So far, we just used memory or file system based
OCM repositories to create component versions.
If we want to store something in a remotely accessible
repository typically some credentials are required
for write access.

The OCM library uses a generic abstraction for credentials.
It is just set of properties. To offer various credential sources
there is an interface `credentials.Credentials` provided,
whose implementations provide access to those properties.
A simple property based implementation is `credentials.DirectCredentials.

The most simple use case is to provide the credentials
directly for the repository access creation.
The example config file provides such credentials
for an OCI registry.

```go
	creds := ociidentity.SimpleCredentials(cfg.Username, cfg.Password)
```

Now, we can use the OCI repository access creation from the [first tour](../01-getting-started/README.md#walkthrough),
but we pass the credentials as additional parameter.
To give you the chance to specify your own registry, the URL
is taken from the config file.

```go
	spec := ocireg.NewRepositorySpec(cfg.Repository, nil)

	repo, err := ctx.RepositoryForSpec(spec, creds)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer repo.Close()
```

If registry name and credentials are fine, we should be able
now to add a new component version to this repository using the coding
from the previous examples, but now we use a public repository, instead
of a memory or file system based one. This coding is in function `addVersion`
in `common.go` (It is shared by the other examples, also).

```go
	cv, err := repo.NewComponentVersion(name, version)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot create new version")
	}
	defer cv.Close()

	err = setupVersion(cv)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot setup new version")
	}

	// finally, wee add the new version to the repository.
	fmt.Printf("adding component version\n")
	err = repo.AddComponentVersion(cv)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot save version")
	}
```

In contrast to our [first tour](../01-getting-started/README.md#getting-started-walkthrough)
we cannot list components, here.
OCI registries do not support component listers, therefore we
just look up the actually added version to verify the result.

```go
	cv, err := repo.LookupComponentVersion("acme.org/example03", "v0.1.0")
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "added version not found")
	}
	defer cv.Close()
	return errors.Wrapf(describeVersion(cv), "describe failed")
```

The coding for `describeVersion` is similar to the one shown in the [first tour](../01-getting-started/README.md#describe-version).

### Using the Credential Management

Passing credentials directly at the repository
is fine, as long only the component version
will be accessed. But as soon as described
resource content will be read, the required
credentials and credential types are dependent
on the concrete component version, because
it might contain any kind of access method
referring to any kind of resource repository
type.

To solve this problem of passing any set
of credentials the OCM context object is
used to store credentials. This is handled
by a sub context, the *Credentials context*.

As usual, we start with the default OCM context.

```go
	ctx := ocm.DefaultContext()
```

It is now used to gain access to the appropriate
credential context.

```go
	credctx := ctx.CredentialsContext()
```

The credentials context brings together
providers of credentials, for example a
Vault or a local Docker config.json
and credential consumers like GitHub or
OCI registries.
It must be able to distinguish various kinds
of consumers. This is done by identifying
a dedicated consumer with a set of properties
called `credentials.ConsumerId`. It consists
at least of a consumer type property and a
consumer type specific set of properties
describing the concrete instance of such
a consumer, for example an OCI artifact in
an OCI registry is identified by a host and
a repository path.

A credential provider like a vault just provides
named credential sets and typically does not
know anything about the use case for these sets.
The task of the credential context is to
provide credentials for a dedicated consumer.
Therefore, it maintains a configurable
mapping of credential sources (credentials in
a credential repository) and a dedicated consumer.

This mapping defines a use case, also based on
a property set and dedicated credentials.
If credentials are required for a dedicated
consumer, it matches the defined mappings and
returned the best matching entry.

Matching? Let's take the GitHub OCI registry as an
example. There are different owners for
different repository paths (the GitHub org/user).
Therefore, different credentials need to be provided
for different repository paths.
For example, credentials for `ghcr.io/acme` can be used
for a repository `ghcr.io/acme/ocm/myimage`.

To start with the credentials context we just
provide an explicit mapping for our use case.

First, we create our credentials object as before.

```go
	creds := ociidentity.SimpleCredentials(cfg.Username, cfg.Password)
```

Then we determine the consumer id for our use case.
The repository implementation provides a function
for this task. It provides the most general property
set (no repository path) for an OCI based OCM repository.

```go
	id, err := oci.GetConsumerIdForRef(cfg.Repository)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "invalid consumer")
	}
```

The used functions above are just convenience wrappers
around the core type ConsumerId, which might be provided
for dedicated repository/consumer technologies.
Everything can be done directly with the core interface
and property name constants provided by the dedicated technologies.

Once we have the id we can finally set the credentials for this
id.

```go
	credctx.SetCredentialsForConsumer(id, creds)
```

Now, the context is prepared to provide credentials
for any usage of our OCI registry
Let's test, whether it could provide credentials
for storing our component version.

First, we get the repository object for our OCM repository.

```go
	spec := ocireg.NewRepositorySpec(cfg.Repository, nil)
	repo, err := ctx.RepositoryForSpec(spec, creds)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer repo.Close()
```

Second, we determine the consumer id for our intended repository access.
A credential consumer may provide consumer id information
for a dedicated sub user context.
This is supported by the OCM repo implementation for OCI registries.
The usage context is here the component name.

```go
	id = credentials.GetProvidedConsumerId(repo, credentials.StringUsageContext("acme.org/example03"))
	if id == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("repository does not support consumer id queries")
	}
	fmt.Printf("usage context: %s\n", id)
```

Third, we ask the credential context for appropriate credentials.
The basic context method `credctx.GetCredentialsForConsumer` returns
a credentials source interface able to provide credentials
for a changing credentials source. Here, we use a convenience
function, which directly provides a credentials interface for the
actually valid credentials.
An error is only provided if something went wrong while determining
the credentials. Delivering NO credentials is a valid result.
The returned interface then offers access to the credential properties.
via various methods.

```go
	creds, err = credentials.CredentialsForConsumer(credctx, id, ociidentity.IdentityMatcher)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "no credentials")
	}
	if creds == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("no credentials found")
	}
	fmt.Printf("credentials: %s\n", obfuscate(creds.Properties()))
```

Now, we can continue with our basic component version composition
from the last example, or we just display the content.

The following code snipped shows the code for the `context` variant
creating a new version, the `read` variant just omits the version creation.
The rest of the example is identical.

```go
	if create {
		// now we create a component version in this repository.
		err = addVersion(repo, "acme.org/example03", "v0.1.0")
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
```

Let's verify the created content and list the versions as known from tour 1.
OCI registries do not support component listers, therefore we
just get and describe the actually added version.

```go
	cv, err := repo.LookupComponentVersion("acme.org/example03", "v0.1.0")
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "added version not found")
	}
	defer cv.Close()

	err = describeVersion(cv)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "describe failed")
	}
```

As we can see in the resource list, our image artifact has been
uploaded to the OCI registry as OCI artifact and the access method has be changed
to `ociArtifact`. It is not longer a local blob.

```go
	res, err := cv.SelectResources(selectors.Name("ocmcli"))
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "accessing ocmcli resource")
	}
	if len(res) != 1 {
		return fmt.Errorf("oops, there are %d entries for ocmcli", len(res))
	}
	meth, err := res[0].AccessMethod()
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot get access method")
	}
	defer meth.Close()

	fmt.Printf("accessing oci image now with %s\n", meth.AccessSpec().Describe(ctx))
```

This resource access effectively points to the same OCI registry,
but a completely different repository.
If you are using *ghcr.io*, this freshly created repo is private,
therefore, we need credentials for accessing the content.
An access method also acts as credential consumer, which
tries to get required credentials from the credential context.
Optionally, an access method can act as provider for a consumer id, so that
it is possible to query the used consumer id from the method object.

```go
	id = credentials.GetProvidedConsumerId(meth, credentials.StringUsageContext("acme.org/example3"))
	if id == nil {
		fmt.Printf("no consumer id info for access method\n")
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("usage context: %s\n", id)
	}
```

Because the credentials context now knows the required credentials,
the access method as credential consumer can access the blob.

```go
	writer, err := os.OpenFile("/tmp/example3", os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC|os.O_WRONLY, 0o644)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot write output file")
	}
	defer writer.Name()

	reader, err := meth.Reader()
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot get reader")
	}
	defer reader.Close()
	n, err := io.Copy(writer, reader)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "cannot copy content")
	}
	fmt.Printf("blob has %d bytes\n", n)
```

### Providing credentials via credential repositories

The OCM toolset embraces multiple storage
backend technologies, for OCM metadata as well
as for artifacts described by a component version.
All those technologies typically have their own
way to configure credentials for command line
tools or servers.

The credential management provides so-called
credential repositories. Such a repository
is able to provide any number of named
credential sets. This way any special
credential store can be connected to the
OCM credential management just by providing
an own implementation for the repository interface.

One such case is the docker config json, a config
file used by <code>docker login</code> to store
credentials for dedicated OCI registries.

We start again by providing access to the
OCM context and the connected credential context.

```go
	ctx := ocm.DefaultContext()
	credctx := ctx.CredentialsContext()
```

In package `.../contexts/credentials/repositories` you can find
packages for predefined implementations for some standard credential repositories,
for example `dockerconfig`.

```go
	dspec := dockerconfig.NewRepositorySpec("~/.docker/config.json")
```

There are general credential stores, like a HashiCorp Vault
or type-specific ones, like the docker config json
used to configure credentials for the docker client.
(working with OCI registries).
Those specialized repository implementations are not only able to
provide credential sets, they also know about the usage context
of the provided credentials.
Therefore, such repository implementations are also able to provide
credential mappings for consumer ids. This is supported by the credential
repository API provided by this library.

The docker config is such a case, so we can instruct the
repository to automatically propagate appropriate the consumer id
mappings. This feature is typically enabled by a dedicated specification
option.

```go
	dspec = dspec.WithConsumerPropagation(true)
```

Implementations for more generic credential repositories can also use this
feature, if the repository allows adding arbitrary metadata. This is for
example used by the `vault` implementation. It uses dedicated attributes
to allow the user to configure intended consumer id properties.

Now, we can just add the repository for this specification to
the credential context by getting the repository object for our
specification.

```go
	_, err := credctx.RepositoryForSpec(dspec)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "invalid credential repository")
	}
```

We are not interested in the repository object, so we just ignore
the result.

So, if you have done the appropriate docker login for your
OCI registry, it should be possible now to get the credentials
for the configured repository.

We first query the consumer id for the repository, again.

```go
	id, err := oci.GetConsumerIdForRef(cfg.Repository)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "invalid consumer")
	}
```

and then get the credentials from the credentials context like in the previous example.

```go
	creds, err := credentials.CredentialsForConsumer(credctx, id, ociidentity.IdentityMatcher)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrapf(err, "no credentials")
	}
	// an error is only provided if something went wrong while determining
	// the credentials. Delivering NO credentials is a valid result.
	if creds == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("no credentials found")
	}
	fmt.Printf("credentials: %s\n", obfuscate(creds.Properties()))
```
