# Composing a Component Version

This tor illustrates the basic usage of the API to
create/compose component versions.

It covers two basic scenarios:
- [`basic`](01-basic-componentversion-creation.go) Create a component version stored in the filesystem
- [`compose`](02-composition-version.go) Create a component version stored in memory using a non-persistent composition version.

You can just call the main program with the scenario as argument.
