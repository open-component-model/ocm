# Localization Tools

This package (pkg/contexts/ocm/util/localize) contains some
structure/format definitions (format.go)
and functions usable for the instantiation of filesystem snapshots
based on OCM localization descriptions and the mangling with
instance configuration input.

There are two basic specification that incorporate external 
information provided by a component version or some user config.

- struct/format `Localization` describe a specification to
  inject/modify image locations based on the information provided
  by a component version

  This specification should be stored as part of a resource in a component
  version, which is then used to apply it. The contained relative
  [resource reference](../../../../../docs/ocm/model.md#resource-reference)
  should evaluated against the component version containing it.

- struct/format `Configuration` describes a specification for
  applying a dedicated config value taken from a configuration source
  to a filesytem snapshot

The function `Localize` and `Configure` accept a list of such 
specifications and map into am environment agnostic set of
`Substitution` specifications, which contain resolved data values, only.

Finally a compound specification `InstantiationRules` is provided,
that combines both with the specification of the snapshot resource and
further helper parts, like json scheme validation for config files.

Such a specification object can be applies by the fuction `Instantiate`,
which file a virtual filesystem with the adjustet snapshot.
